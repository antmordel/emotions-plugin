# Changelog
### 2.1.0
- Added full support for Palladio specifications. We provided [an explicit behavior for the Palladio Component Model][1]. In that paper, transformations performing the flattening of the input Palladio models had to be independently executed. In the current version of the tool, we provide a new button ![palladio button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-motions/e-motions_plugin/master/e-motions_plugin/icons/palladio.png) that triggers its execution automatically.
- Since fulfilling the *Palladio in e-Motions* dialog is quite cumbersome, the last launch is saved so that it can be re-used. The project containing the file with the rules should be selected before triggering the *Palladio in e-Motions* dialog.
